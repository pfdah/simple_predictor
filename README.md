# Self Implementation for Algorithm

A task where we implemented Multiclass logistic regression from scratch and tested the model.
 

## Installation

Install the required packages

 ```bash
  pip install pandas
  pip install numpy
  pip install matlpotlib
  pip install seaborn
  pip install scikit-learn
  pip install pickle
```
   

## Lessons Learned

* To create a simple ML model.
* Confusion matrix for multiclass classification.
* Use of pickle model to save the objects
* Import of methods from self created module
* Use of ROC performance metric
